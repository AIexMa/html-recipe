        <u><i><h4>Steps</h4></i></u>
        <ol>
        <li>
          Bring slightly salted water to a boil in a large pot. Cook the noodles until tender but firm.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the noodles cook, dice the bacon and cook it in the olive oil until just lightly crisped in a medium saute pan. Pour off the excess fat, reserving 4 tablespoons in the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a bowl, beat the eggs and season with a little salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drain the noodles, saving about 2 tablespoons of water for later. If the pan has cooled down, warm it up again right before adding the noodles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the noodles to the warm bacon in the pan; thoroughly toss with the oil and bacon and season with salt. Work fast and pour the beaten eggs onto the warm noodles and mix well to coat the noodles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the reserved pasta water if the noodles look dry. The heat of the noodles and the pan will thicken and set the eggs. If there is not enough heat, turn the burner on very low, just to warm the noodles, then turn it off. Too much heat can scramble the eggs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the noodles, egg and bacon are well mixed, add freshly grated Parmesean cheese and stir. Freshly ground black pepper is an essential addition. Serve in warm pasta bowls.
        </li>
        </ol>
